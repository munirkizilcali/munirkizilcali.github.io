I am a full stack web developer with experience in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, React and Redux. During college years I worked as a freelance web developer. After graduation, I worked for 9 years as a Network Presales Manager. During all that time, I realized that I missed writing code and building things. After moving to DC, I found the chance to follow my dreams, quit network operations and sales and be at the creative side again. I bring strong skills in technical project management, understanding business and technical needs and visualizing technical design. I have Bs in Computer sciences with Ms degree on Engineering Management. I have strong low level electronics and programming background. I am strong on complex algorithms, and always curious about new web technologies. Regular attendee of development meet ups.
